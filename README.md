# A Statistical Analysis of Home Team Performance in High Scoring MLB Games

## Project Overview
This project looks at data from the MLB (raw data available in repo) and analyzes whether or not the Home Team of a baseball game has an advantage in high scoring games. The theory behind the analysis is that in high scoring games, fans are more engaged as there is more action. With more fan engagement, fan impact on the game is increased, which benefits the Home Team. 

To test this theory, the project utilizes a z-test for statistical significance and bootstrapping for sample enhancing. The project is conducted using RStudio. 

## Findings
The findings are presented in a PDF report that can be found in this repository.
