# An Analysis of Home Team Performance in High-Scoring MLB Games

## Project Overview
### Introduction 
In Major League Baseball, Americaâ€™s premier baseball league, the home team is
considered to have an advantage by virtue of having the support of the crowd. This is backed up
by years of statistics that show that teams, almost always, have a higher winning percentage
playing at home versus playing on the road. However, in this report, we explore a more nuanced
question: do home teams have an advantage in high scoring games compared to in normal
scoring games? Before running any statistical tests or analyses, we hypothesize that indeed when
games are high scoring, the home team is especially at an advantage. We claim this because high
scoring games may involve many swings in leads and bursts of offense, which the home crowd
can help sway in the favor of their home team. Additionally, as more runs are scored, the home
crowd perhaps becomes more rambunctious, energizing the home team. To test this beyond just
theory, we move on to the methodology of this analysis. 

## Findings
The findings are presented in a PDF report that can be found in this repository.
